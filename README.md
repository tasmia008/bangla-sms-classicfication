# bangla-sms-classicfication
This code is a Colab  script for performing sentiment analysis on Bengali text. It starts by importing necessary libraries such as pandas, nltk, and regular expression. Then it loads a dataset containing Bengali text data for sentiment analysis. Next, it defines functions for cleaning the text data, removing stopwords, and tokenizing the text. After preprocessing the text data, it vectorizes the text using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction.

Then, it splits the dataset into training and testing sets, and it trains several machine learning models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, XGBoost, and Stacking Classifier. The models are evaluated using various classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, it visualizes the confusion matrix and plots ROC curves for model evaluation. Finally, it reports the performance metrics for each model. Overall, the code demonstrates a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis on Bengali text using machine learning techniques in Python.
